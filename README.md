# AWS CloudFormation Template Flip

## About

AWS CloudFormation Template Flip is a tool that converts [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates between [JSON](http://json.org/) and [YAML](http://yaml.org) formats, making use of the YAML formatâ€™s short function syntax where possible.

The term "Flip" is inspired by the well-known Unix command-line tool [flip](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~craig/utility/flip/) which converts text files between Unix, Mac, and MS-DOS formats.

## Installation

AWS CloudFormation Template Flip can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install cfn_flip
```

## Usage

AWS CloudFormation Template Flip is both a command line tool and a python library.

Note that the command line tool is spelled `cfn-flip` with a hyphen, while the python package is `cfn_flip` with an underscore.
